Why Objects are copied & compared by reference ?

Objects are copied by reference can be justified by following points.

1.An object takes lot of memory as compared to primitive types,for proper memory management objects are referred.

2.Js follow flyweigth pattern by default which tries to reduce the same memory allocation to same objects

3.Copying an object is complex as an objects can have nested objects inside each other.

4.A user can create a new object manually by creating new reference but by default it gives the same referencec

for ex:
 var obj={'akshay':'agrawal'}
var person=obj

person is obj and obj is person

In order to create a new reference I need to run a loop.
This is done so mostly to reduce  data redundancy and memory management.
