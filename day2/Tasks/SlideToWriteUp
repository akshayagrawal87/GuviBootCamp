1.What do users see whenthere's a JavaS cript error on a web page?

User Might see nothing or might face problem in functionality

If an error is possible, someone will make it. The designer must assume that all possible errors will occur and design so as to minimize the chance ofthe error in the first place, or its
effects once it gets made. 

Errors should be easy to detect,they should have minimal
consequences, and, if possible,their effects should be reversible.

We should always assume that our code will fail and not make assumtions that it will work on every scenario.

We need to follow certain rules while coding to make it error
free.

Rule 1

Assume code will fail and prepare accordingly

For ex

function(souce,dest){
}
here we are calling a function!but what if sorce and dest are undefine?


Rule 2

Log the errors to server

It is a coding convention these days to use a logger to save the bugs and error caused in the system

Rule 3

As a developer we should be responsible to hadnling error scenarios not the browser

We should using try catch aroud our logic
as It provides more details about the error and catch handles some of the error we thought that might occur.
