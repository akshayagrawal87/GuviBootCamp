Why Objects are copied & compared by reference ?

Objects are assigned and copied by reference primitive types are copied by value not reference.

In case of objects it done to reduce the complexity and save memory and if needed user can perfom deep copy to copy a objects
but by defult it allocates a reference value in the memory pool

It foloows flyweight pattern which is all about saving memory as much as possoible

it allow speed ups the process.

All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.
